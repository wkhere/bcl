+ make tokens unexported
+ handle division by zero

+ add line info from lex to eval errors

more on errors:
+ return all errors (modulo parser sync)
- when it's done, consider adding BCL to github.com/Boeing/config-file-validator

+ bin ops: 
  == !=        # for int float str bool
    < > <= >=  # for int float str
  and or       # for bool, short-circuit

- builtin functions:
  - getenv(key)
  - cmd(...) to run commands and catch the output!
  - simple type conversions: 42 @str, expr @bool
  - consider replacing cmd & type conversions with sigils

+ fix: when a field is defined more than once, only the last clause
  is evaluated; should evaluate all then overwrite with the last one
  (1. current behavior unintuitive, 2. prep for side-effect exprs like ++i)
= not occuring in the vm version

+ consider fields to be resolvable like vars in the scope of the current block;
  then they would act like local vars
= done in the vm version

- lists - in two variants: with the same type and varying types
  - as lists can be nested, there is a need to encode variety of such types

+ nested blocks; design carefully
= done in the vm version

~ ability to use reference to other block's field, possibly nested
= partly done in the vm version in the way that in the nested block expr can
  refer to the field in any of the parend blocks; what remains to be done is:
  - ability to use paths to all blocks/fields across the whole file 

- unmarshaling options:
  - allow fields to be missing in the target struct
  - allow struct type to be named differently than block type
    (at runtime, without struct tags)

+ vm impl

- test cases for assignments inside expr, to demonstrate they are valid

- reflection: allow filling toplevel structs of different types

- when the language and vm is stable, port to Python, Ruby, Zig, ...
  ~ way to port in small steps is to make prog struct fully serializable
    and port the vm first


- functions, frames, call stack, prog->chunks
- native functions
- can the approach "all vars are local" play well with functions and frames?
- reintroduce global & local vars; how does idents resolving play with fields?

- sort out scopes for processing multiple files (one prog vs many progs)
  -> this will be easier after functions

- reflection: when there is inner non-anonymous struct and its type differs
  from the block type, there is no way to bind it - struct tag is only about
  the name/key
