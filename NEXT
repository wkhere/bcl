+ make yacc tokens unexported
+ handle division by zero

- add line info from lex to eval errors

- bin ops: 
	== !=      # for int float str bool
    < > <= >=  # for int float str
 	and or 	   # for bool, short-circuit

- builtin functions:
	- getenv(key)
	- cmd(...) to run commands and catch the output!
	- simple type conversion
	- consider replacing cmd & type conversions with sigils

- compatibility with HCL-style resources, which look like:
  resource "type" "name" .... { }

- nested structs/dicts; design carefully

- ability to use reference to other block's field, possibly nested
